# Hi, I'm Toggy ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aerospace software engineer at [Leonardo UK](https://uk.leonardo.com) and I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/). I'm passionate about software engineering, but I sometimes dabble into web development and other fields. I share a lot of my work here on GitHub, and I've still got a lot to learn, so I wouldn't mind any constructive feedback :)
