# Hi, I'm Toggy ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and working as an Industrial Placement Software Engineer for [Leonardo](https://uk.leonardo.com). Although my primary interest is software engineering, I sometimes dabble into web development and other fields. I share a lot of my work here on GitHub and I've still got a lot to learn so I wouldn't mind any constructive feedback :)
