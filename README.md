### About

Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Toggy Smith, an 18-year-old programmer from the UK and I'm currently studying [Computer Science with a Year Abroad BSc](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-with-a-year-abroad-bsc "Computer Science with a Year Abroad BSc") at King's College London.

My two most experienced fields of expertise are programming in C++ and using the Godot game engine.

I love learning new things; at the moment I'm teaching myself how to play the acoustic guitar and read and write in German. I enjoy the challenge and the pleasure of slowly mastering something, whether it be a musical instrument or a language. I'm also an avid walker. I try to spend about an hour each day walking to brainstorm ideas for the future but also sometimes to just relax mentally.
