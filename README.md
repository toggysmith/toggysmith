### About

Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Toggy Smith, an 18-year-old programmer from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ currently enjoying my summer and looking for a part-time job after having completed my A-levels. In September, I'll be heading off to university to complete a computer science degree with a year abroad. My firm choice is King's College London and my insurance choice is Westminster University.

My two most experienced fields of expertise are programming in C++ and using the Godot game engine. Currently, I'm starting a YouTube channel to teach people how to create things in Godot.

I love learning new things; at the moment I'm teaching myself how to play the acoustic guitar ðŸŽ¸ and read and write in German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. I enjoy the challenge and the pleasure of slowly mastering something, whether it be a musical instrument or a language. I'm also an avid walker ðŸ‘Ÿ. I try to spend about an hour each day walking to brainstorm ideas for the future but also sometimes to just relax mentally.

### Skills & Qualifications

Languages:
- C++
