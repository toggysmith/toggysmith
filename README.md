# ðŸ‘‰ About me...

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Toggy Smith!

I'm an aspiring software developer and undergraduate student at King's College London studying Computer Science with a Year in Industry (BSc). I have a strong passion for learning and although I want to pursue a career in software development, I'm interested in other computer science fields like data science, machine learning and game development.

# ðŸ‘‰ I'm working on...

- Recreating my personal website using React and Material UI.

# ðŸ‘‰ I'm learning...

- JavaScript from scratch using [this excellent tutorial](https://javascript.info) to fill any gaps in my knowledge/understanding.

# ðŸ‘‰ My projects...

During my time at King's, I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of great teams and a lot of our projects feature on here. You can find any projects done at King's on my [assignments](https://github.com/toggysmith/toggysmith/blob/main/assignments.md) page. I also have many of my own projects; I'm still learning and would appreciate any feedback. I've included some of my favourite projects below:

- [Predator and Prey Simulation](https://github.com/toggysmith/predator-and-prey-simulation)
- [Circle Dodger](https://github.com/toggysmith/Circle-Dodger)
- [3D Terrain Generator](https://github.com/toggysmith/3D-Terrain-Generator)
- [2D Terrain Generator](https://github.com/toggysmith/2D-Terrain-Generator)
- [Boids Simulation](https://github.com/toggysmith/Boids-Simulation)
