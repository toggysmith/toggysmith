# Hello!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Computer Science (with a Year in Industry)](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-with-a-year-in-industry-bsc) undergraduate at King's College London. I'm currently also enrolled on the [Full Stack Engineer course on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

Some of my other hobbies outside of programming include learning German, playing the guitar, reading and gaming.
