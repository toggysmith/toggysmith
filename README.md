# ðŸ‘‰ About me...

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Toggy Smith!

I'm an aspiring software developer and undergraduate student at King's College London studying Computer Science with a Year in Industry (BSc). I have a strong passion for learning and although I want to pursue a career in software development, I'm interested in other computer science fields like data science, machine learning and game development.

# ðŸ‘‰ I'm working on...

- Getting prepared for my next assignment by getting more familiar with IntelliJ IDEA, GitHub Desktop and best practices like the [Conventional Commit Style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

# ðŸ‘‰ I'm learning...

- [Full Stack Engineer Career Path on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path): I have an interest in building desktop apps with Electron.js so I'm learning foundational knowledge like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, etc.
- [Analyze Data with SQL Skill Path on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/analyze-data-with-sql): I'm practising SQL which I'm learning at King's because I struggle with a lack of actual practice and I believe SQL is a useful skill in any computer science field.
- [Pass the Technical Interview with Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-java): I'm learning more about data structures to solidify my understanding as I consider them important to every programmer.

# ðŸ‘‰ My projects...

During my time at King's, I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of great teams and a lot of our projects feature on here. You can find any projects done at King's on my [assignments](https://github.com/toggysmith/toggysmith/blob/main/assignments.md) page. I also have many of my own projects; I'm still learning and would appreciate any feedback. I've included some of my favourite projects below:

- [Predator and Prey Simulation](https://github.com/toggysmith/predator-and-prey-simulation)
- [Circle Dodger](https://github.com/toggysmith/Circle-Dodger)
- [3D Terrain Generator](https://github.com/toggysmith/3D-Terrain-Generator)
- [2D Terrain Generator](https://github.com/toggysmith/2D-Terrain-Generator)
- [Boids Simulation](https://github.com/toggysmith/Boids-Simulation)
