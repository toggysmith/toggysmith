### About

Hiya! 👋 I'm Toggy Smith, an 18-year-old programmer from the UK currently enjoying my summer and looking for a part-time job after having completed my A-levels. I'm an incoming King's College London undergraduate getting ready to start Computer Science with a Year Abroad.

My two most experienced fields of expertise are programming in C++ and using the Godot game engine.

I love learning new things; at the moment I'm teaching myself how to play the acoustic guitar and read and write in German. I enjoy the challenge and the pleasure of slowly mastering something, whether it be a musical instrument or a language. I'm also an avid walker. I try to spend about an hour each day walking to brainstorm ideas for the future but also sometimes to just relax mentally.

### Skills & Qualifications

Languages:
- C++
- Python
- C
- Rust
- JS, HTML & CSS

I studied computer science (A*), politics (A*) and mathematics (A) at A-level. In my GCSEs, I received five 9's, two 8's, two 7's and one B. I also completed a cyber security EPQ (CyberEPQ) when I was just 14 (the youngest on the course), achieving a C.
