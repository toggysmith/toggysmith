# ðŸ‘‰ About me...

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Toggy Smith!

I'm an aspiring software developer and undergraduate student at King's College London studying Computer Science with a Year in Industry (BSc). I have a strong passion for learning and although I want to pursue a career in software development, I'm interested in other computer science fields like data science, machine learning and game development.
