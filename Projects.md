# Projects

It's hard to organise repositories on GitHub so I created this file for that purpose.

## Archived

I have some older projects which I have "archived", usually becuase they are from when I was much younger and I no longer find the quality of them representative of my skill. They are still publicly accessible on my GitHub but I don't show them on my website.
