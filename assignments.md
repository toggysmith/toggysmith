# Assignments

## Introduction

This page is intended to provide a quick overview of the assignments that I have completed in my time at King's College London.

I have broken it down in chronological order by semester and year as I believe this is more useful at showing my progress over time than a breakdown by module. The first two assignments are missing as they were relatively simple and short, and because of this I never put them on GitHub, so I have sadly been unable to find them again. You can find module codes and their corresponding full names at the bottom of the page.

As a student, I am always continuing to learn and would appreciate any feedback.
